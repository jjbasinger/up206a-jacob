## FEMA Flood Insurance Data
- This is shape data for FEMA's flood insurance rate map in San Diego County.
- I would like to use this data for a sea level rise related project, perhaps by comparing it to where water is projected to rise or to socioeconomic data.
- I obtained this data from the FEMA Flood Map Service Center: https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch#searchresultsanchor.
- This data can be found: https://github.com/jjbasinger/up206a-jacob/tree/main/Data/FEMA%20flood%20insurance%20data%20SD%20County.
## ACS Shoreline Counties
- This is spreadsheet and shapefile data for the American Communities Survey, specifically for shoreline counties in the United States.
- I would like to use this data for a sea level rise project as well, probably by comparing it to the FEMA insurance rates.
- I obtained this data from NOAA's Office for Coastal Management, here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/.
- This data can be found: https://github.com/jjbasinger/up206a-jacob/blob/main/Data/ACS_ShorelineCounties.xlsx and https://github.com/jjbasinger/up206a-jacob/blob/main/Data/coastal_shoreline_counties_2010.zip
