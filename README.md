# up206a-jacob
Hi!  My name is Jacob Basinger and I am a fourth-year concurrent Law and MURP student.  I am concentrating on EAP and D&D in the MURP program.
This course is UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science.
I do not have any specific project ideas at the moment, but I would like to work on something related to the environment.  I am particular interested in coastal environmental problems, so maybe my project could focus on something like sea level rise vulnerability - perhaps by mapping the areas that will be most affected by sea level rise, or even mapping flood insurance costs and their relation to sea level rise.
My objectives for this class include refamiliarizing myself with GIS, since I took some courses as an undergraduate, and preparing myself for potentially working with GIS and Spatial Data in the future.  Although my law degree does not have a close nexus to GIS (at least as of now), I am hoping I can utilize the skills from this course to supplement my ability to be an environmental advocate in the future.
