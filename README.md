# up206a-jacob
Hi!  My name is Jacob Basinger and I am a fourth-year concurrent Law and MURP student.  I am concentrating on EAP and D&D in the MURP program.
This course is UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science, and this is my project space for the quarter.
I do not have any specific project ideas at the moment, but I would like to work on something related to the environment.  I am particular interested in coastal environmental problems, so maybe my project could focus on something like sea level rise vulnerability - perhaps by mapping the areas that will be most affected by sea level rise, or even mapping flood insurance costs and their relation to sea level rise.  I am also interested in potentially pursuing a project related to renewable energy.
My objectives for this class include refamiliarizing myself with GIS, since I took some courses as an undergraduate, and preparing myself for potentially working with GIS and Spatial Data in the future.  Although my law degree does not have a close nexus to GIS (at least as of now), I am hoping I can utilize the skills from this course to supplement my ability to be an environmental advocate in the future.
